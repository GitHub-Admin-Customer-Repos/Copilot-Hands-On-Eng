# GitHub Copilot TypeScript Labs

We will be using a simple api project to practice enhancing an existing project with new functionality.  The project is a simple API that manages Products.

# Directions

To enhance the project, we can consider the following improvements:

# Additional Enhancements:
1. Database Models:
    - Integrate a database and create models for entities like `User`, `Order`, `Product`, etc.
2. Middleware:
    - Add middleware for logging, error handling, and request validation.
3. Services:
    - Create service classes to handle business logic, separating it from controllers.
4. Utilities:
    - Add utility functions for common tasks like date formatting, data validation, etc.
5. Configuration:
    - Create a configuration module to manage environment variables and application settings.
6. Error Handling:
    - Implement a centralized error handling mechanism.
7. Testing:
    - Add more comprehensive unit and integration tests.

# Challenge: with extra time:
1. Role Based Access Control (RBAC):
    - Implement roles (e.g., admin, user) and restrict access to certain endpoints based on the user's role.
2. Rate Limiting:
    - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API.
3. API Documentation:
    - Use tools like Swagger or Redoc to generate interactive API documentation.
