# GitHub Copilot CSharp Labs

We will be using a simple api project to practice enhancing an existing project with new functionality.  The project is a simple API that manages users and orders.  The project is written in Python and uses the Flask web framework.

# Directions

1. Use Copilot to determine the best way to enhance the project with new functionality.  This can include asking Copilot for how it thinks we can enhance the project as well as the code to implement the new functionality.

Examples:
- Add Update Methods: Add methods to update fields of the models.
- Add Validation Methods: Add methods to validate the data before saving or updating.
- Manage Relationships: Add methods to manage relationships between models, such as adding items to an order
- Update the unit tests in app_tests.py to test the new functionality.

2. Use Copilot to add a new endpoint to the project that allows users to login and receive a JWT token.
